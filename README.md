Yet Another Web Framework Shootout
==================================

The idea for this project is to implement a non-trival application 
using a variety of web frameworks. The time and effort will be measured 
as well as the developers appreciate for each framework. Each implementation 
will reuse the same HTML user-interface, adapted to each frameworks templating 
system. The final rendered HTML should be virtually the same.

The Sample Project
------------------

The developers have tentatively decided to implement a social bookmarking 
application Ã  la delicio.us. The application should have the following functionality.
- User registration
- Authenticated users can post URLs to bookmark publicly or privately
- Authenticated users can upvote or otherwise note their URLs
- URLs can be commented
- URLs can have associated keywords (tags)
- Authenticated users can note public URLs of any user
- (more to come...)

### Technical Wishes
The best aspects of each framework should be used. Most will have the following
- Friendly URLs
- Transparent data access / object persistence
- Intelligent Form handling
- Unit-testable
- Beautiful code


Frameworks
------------
The initial idea was to test Python frameworks. This has been expanded to 
include virtually any framework that appears to be interesting in its design 
and/or implementation or which distinguishes itself in some original way.
